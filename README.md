_*#PyDex*_

•••Just a little project to put what i have learned so far, when it comes to python.
•••Learning how to traceback errors, adjusting formatting, layouts etc.••

•••Upon inputting a number(pokedex reference), or a pokemon name, this project will
••return the Sprite(image), Name, Dex number and Types(s).••

•••I plan to revisit this and eventually make it look more like a Pokedex from the show,
••along with it being more complex; showing shiny sprites, megaevolutions etc.

_*## Usage*_

    1. pypokedex #required to run -- **pip3 install pypokedex**
    2. pillow #required to run -- **pip3 install pillow**
    3. urllib3 #no need to install as is a dependency for pypokedex
    4. ByteIO
    5. Tkinter
